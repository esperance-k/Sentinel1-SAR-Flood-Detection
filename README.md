# SAR Flood Detection using Sentinel-1

This repository contains the Google Earth Engine (GEE) code and results
for detecting flood-induced changes using Sentinel-1 SAR intensity data.
The study area is Kinshasa (DR Congo).

## Course
Introduction to Active Remote Sensing

## Data
- Sentinel-1 SAR (VV polarization)
- Pre- and post-flood acquisitions

## Methodology
- SAR intensity compositing
- Change detection using backscatter difference
- Threshold-based flood mapping

## Results
The output is a flooded area map highlighting areas affected by flooding.
